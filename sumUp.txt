Flow in plain terms:

User Login

Enter email + phone (no full password needed for POC)

Backend (Express) validates and returns a session token

View Bookings

Frontend calls backend (/bookings)

Backend fetches bookings from ServiceM8 API

Frontend displays list

View Booking Details

Click a booking → /bookings/:id

Backend fetches job details (and attachments if needed) from ServiceM8

Frontend displays details + attachments

Send Messages

User can type messages tied to that booking

Backend stores messages locally (JSON or in-memory)

Frontend renders them

That’s it.

Everything else (attachments, messages) can be mocked or stored simply.

Minimal UI; functionality over style.

ServiceM8 API call = only for bookings and details.
